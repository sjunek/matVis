Key features of matVis include\r\n  - Easy data input: load variables from the workspace or various image file\r\n    formats including Zeiss lsm-files and .mat-files\r\n  - Easy navigation through data sets of arbitrary dimension\r\n  - Easy to learn user interface with tooltips for each control item\r\n  - Visualize multiple data sets of identical dimensions in parallel\r\n  - Histogram-guided contrast adjustment including gamma correction and\r\n    algorithmic thresholding\r\n  - Large variety of colormaps\r\n  - Image and plot filter\r\n  - Image projections including image tiling\r\n  - RGB display including color-coded max- and mean-projections ('RGB\r\n    stretch')\r\n  - Extensive region of interest manager\r\n  - Video generator, which can combine the content of mutiple windows into  \r\n    a single customizable movie\r\n  - Specify scales, names and units for the data dimensions\r\n  - Use of alpha data including contrast and gamma adjustments\r\n  - 2D histogram for image data / alpha data with histogram guided 2D \r\n    contrast adjustment\r\n  - Figure and function handles can be accessed from 'outside', making\r\n    matVis easy to integrate with other GUIs or Matlab functions\r\n  - Save configuration (settings, window positions, ...) for future use\r\n  - Use 'startPar' argument to selectively overwrite configuration\r\n    paramaters (see below for list of start parameters)\r\n  - Check for updates from within the main GUI\r\n \r\n### Input Arguments\r\n    -none-                      Select image file(s) (including matrices \r\n                                saved as .mat-file, multi-image tif, Zeiss \r\n                                lsm-files, RGB files, animated gif and most \r\n                                other image formats) via uigetfile. Files \r\n                                can be combined into a single matrix or \r\n                                opened \"in parallel\".\r\n    data1, data2, ...

In case there is one data set, \r\n                                                    the values of the fields are four element vectors [x0, y0, width, height], in case there are nMat data sets, \r\n                                                    the values are matrices of size nMat x 4.\r\n                                                    WARNING: gui Position includs TooltipDisplay!!!\r\n \r\n### Output Argument (optional)\r\n     Structure containing the following fields:\r\n        - figHandles: figure handles to all figures, including main GUI\r\n        - fctHandles: function handles of functions useful for 'data\r\n          exchange' or 'external' update of matVis settings\r\n        - settings: structure containing information about current settings\r\n          (currently zoom and zoomXY)\r\n        - dataName: cell array containing names of the loaded data\r\n \r\n### Mouse actions\r\n    Left click and drag                      Draw zoom region\r\n    Right click                              Unzoom\r\n    Left click and drag in Zoom Rectangle    Move zoom region (pan)\r\n    Middle click or Shift + left click       Move Position Lines\r\n    Double click                             Copy content of current figure\r\n                                             to clipboard (either as bitmap or vector graphics).\r\n                                             Works only for Windows OS.\r\n    Right click in main gui                  Bring all visibile windows on\r\n                                             top of the screen\r\n    Scroll Wheel (Matlab 2007a or later)     Zoom in and out (for zoom and\r\n                                             image windows)\r\n \r\n### Keyboard\r\n    Instead of using sliders or text boxes to change the current position values,\r\n    you can use the number keys on the keyboard instead. Press '1' to increase\r\n    the current value of Dim1 by one, press 'control'+'1' to decrease its\r\n    value by one,... This is however only possible if the main gui is the\r\n    current figure (i.e. the selected window) and none of its controls is active\r\n    (click in some empty space within the gui if it doesn't work as you\r\n    expect).\r\n    Works also only for the first nine dimensions :(\r\n \r\n### RGB Display\r\n    RGB display can be toggled with the RGB button. You can use RGB display\r\n    for each dimension that is not used as either 'x' or 'y' dimension. As\r\n    you press the RGB button you switch between all possible dimensions.\r\n    The current image is displayed as the green channel, the preceding as\r\n    red and the succeeding as the blue channel. If there are only two\r\n    values in the selected dimension the blue channel will be left empty.\r\n    If you select the 'Stretch RGB' option, a colormap along the complete\r\n    dimension will be created such that red corresponds to high intensities\r\n    in the initial part, green to high intensities in the intermediate part,\r\n    and blue to high intensities in the late part of the selected\r\n    dimension. Changing the position of the slider of this dimension does\r\n    not have any effect.\r\n",
